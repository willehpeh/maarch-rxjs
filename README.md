# MaarchRxjs

RxJS + NgRx + Entity training.

Clone, run `npm install`. If you have `json-server` installed locally, you can run it using the provided `db.json` file. I recommend adding an artificial delay.

If there is no `json-server`, the code will not function. Reference only in this case.

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 7.3.8.

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.
